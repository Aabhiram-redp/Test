  <p>The Arctic Tern design is one in a series of shapely double enders by Scottish Designer Iain Oughtred.
     Influenced by the traditional workboats of the Shetland Islands especially the Ness Yoles and Sixerns.
     Unlike the workboats, which are rather heavy and burdensome, Iain's designs take advantage of modern
     materials and thus are lighter and lean toward performance, windward sailing ability, and general handiness.</p>

<p>A mountain pass is a route through a mountain range or over a ridge.
  Since many of the world's mountain ranges have presented formidable barriers to travel,
  passes have been important since before recorded history, and have played a key role in trade, war, and migration.
  At lower elevations it may be called a hill pass. The highest pass is Mana Pass, located in the Himalayas on the border between India and China.</p>

  <h2>Scandinavian Mountains</h2>

 <p>The Scandinavian Mountains or the Scandes is a mountain range that runs through the Scandinavian Peninsula.
   The Scandinavian Mountains are often erroneously thought to be equivalent to the Scandinavian Caledonides.
    The western sides of the mountains drop precipitously into the North Sea and Norwegian Sea, forming the famous fjords of Norway,
    whereas to the northeast they gradually curve towards Finland. To the north they form the border between Norway and Sweden,
    still reaching 2,000 m high (6,600 ft) at the Arctic Circle. The mountain range just touches northwesternmost Finland,
     but are scarcely more than hills at their northernmost extension at the North Cape<p><hr>
